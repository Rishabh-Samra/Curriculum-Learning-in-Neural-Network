# Curriculum-Learning-in-Neural-Network
* We demonstrated the concept of curriculum learning on neural networks, where we trained a network initially on the custom-made lines dataset and used their initial layer weights as the initialization for the training on characters dataset.
* We could clearly observe that learning from scratch was much slower as compared to learning from these pretrained weights
